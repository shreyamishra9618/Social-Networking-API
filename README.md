## Description
It is a Social Network API using MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Mongoose, and Express.js.

A user can use this API to create new users with a valid username and email, add other users as friends, and post "thoughts" and "reactions" (similar to comments and replies). Users can also update and delete thoughts and reactions as well as remove friends. Try it out by creating your own username and start interacting with friends!

## Installation
To run this code, simply clone the code, open the cloned code in your favorite IDE, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then run `npm start` to start the server.

### Technical Criteria


  * Uses the [Mongoose package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) to connect to a MongoDB database.
  * Uses functionality to format queried timestamps properly.
  * No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.
